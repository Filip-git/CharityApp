          Welcome to our charity donation platform! Our goal is to connect generous donors with charities in need of support. Whether you want to make a one-time donation or set up recurring donations to causes that matter to you, we're here to help you make a difference.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
          On our platform, guests can browse charities, and registered users can donate, track their donations, and set giving goals. Admins manage the platform by overseeing charities and user donations.
